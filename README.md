# Disaster-Tweets-Classification
The main objective of the project is to identify real disaster tweets from within a dataset of tweets which consists of both disaster and non-disaster tweets. This is sometimes a challenging task as the human natural language can use words such as 'ablaze' to describe a bright sunny sky, for example.

Used Fastai for prediction and obtained 81% accuracy. FastText gave an accuracy of 80%. Working on BERT as a possible choice for increasing accuracy.
